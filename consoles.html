                                    Nintendo 3DS includes two screens. The bottom touch screen makes use of a telescoping stylus that is stored in the unit itself.

The system also has a 3D Depth Slider that lets players select the level of 3D they enjoy the most. The 3D effect can be ratcheted up to the highest level, scaled back to a more moderate setting or even turned off completely, depending on the preference of the user. Nintendo 3DS Features: 3D Upper Screen, Touch Lower Screen, New input & controls, Inward-Facing Camera, 3D Depth Slider, Wireless Switch, Dual Outward-Facing Cameras, Augmented Reality (AR) Games and built-in applications, Circle Pad, Gyro Sensor, Motion Sensor and Pedometer.
